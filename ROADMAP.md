## Risk Management

### Potential Risks
1. **Offline synchronization complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple offline storage, then gradually enhance
   - Fallback: Provide clear error messaging for sync failures

2. **Performance issues with large datasets**
   - Mitigation: Implement pagination and virtualization early
   - Fallback: Limit data display and add more filtering options

3. **Mobile responsiveness challenges**
   - Mitigation: Mobile-first development approach
   - Fallback: Create simplified mobile views if needed

4. **Security vulnerabilities**
   - Mitigation: Regular security audits and following best practices
   - Fallback: Limit sensitive operations until security is verified

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- Application passes all tests
- Performance meets benchmarks
- Security audit passes
- Accessibility compliance achieved

### User Success
- Judges can complete ratings efficiently
- Admins can manage events and view results easily
- Score calculation is accurate and transparent
